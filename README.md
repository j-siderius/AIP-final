# AIP-final

#### Final project for the CreaTe MOD6 course AI Programming.

This Zombie survival game is based in a far away, hexagonally shaped world.
The objective of the game is to survive [ ] nights and days until help arrives to save you.
The player is stranded on a island with lush fields, dense forests and big mountains.
There are resources to be mined and fortifications to be built.
But watch out, at night, zombies come out of the ground and try to eat you.

The game is completely written in Python, utilizing the [PyGame library](https://www.pygame.org/).
The player can be controlled via the mouse or by using the external Nunchuck controller 
which integrates a LED clock that keeps the games time as well.

The terrain is generated by utilizing the [Perlin Noise library](https://pypi.org/project/perlin-noise/).
The communication with the arduino that drives the LED clock and controller is accompliced by using the
[PySerial library](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/) and a custom communication protocol.
