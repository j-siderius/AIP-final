## Project description

Turn-based strategic survival game

The player is dropped into a randomly generated, hexagonal world (perlin noise height map).
Players goal is to survive a number of nights in this land, until rescue arrives.
Every night, enemies will spawn and try to chase down the player (A* pathfinding).
During the day, player can build walls by harvesting resources and finding strategic environments.
Plot twist: time only moves, when you move.
